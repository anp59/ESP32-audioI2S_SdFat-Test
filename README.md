This example shows the use of the SdFat ESP32-audioI2S library together with the ESP32-audioI2S library. 
The slightly adapted libraries [https://github.com/anp59/ESP32-audioI2S.git] and [https://github.com/anp59/SdFat.git] contained in this repository must be integrated into the project. 
In ESP32-audioI2S, only the name of a header file has been changed.
